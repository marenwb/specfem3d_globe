 Max norm displacement vector U in solid in all slices for forward prop. (m) =    5.83892870E-07
 Max non-dimensional potential Ufluid in fluid in all slices for forward prop. =    0.00000000    

 Elapsed time in seconds =   0.63151435999999994     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 00 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.12630287199999998     

 Time steps done =            5  out of         1300
